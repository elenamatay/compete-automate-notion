    "1.  **Notion Integration Token:** Create a Notion integration and get your internal integration token. See [Notion's Guide](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration). Grant the integration access to the parent page where the database will be created.\n",
    "2.  **Parent Page ID:** In Notion, create or choose an existing page where you want the new Competitor Database to be created. Get its ID. You can get the page ID from its URL (the last part of the URL, e.g., for `https://www.notion.so/My-Page-abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890`, the ID is `abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890`). Make sure this page is shared with your integration.\n",
    "3.  **Install requirements:** Ensure you have `requirements.txt` installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`). It should include `google-cloud-aiplatform`, `google-generativeai`, and `notion-client`."
