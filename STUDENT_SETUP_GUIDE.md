## Step 4: Set Up Google Cloud Authentication

1. **Create Google Cloud Account** (if you don't have one):
   - Go to https://cloud.google.com/
   - Sign up with your Google account
   - You'll get $300 in free credits

2. **Create a New Project**:
   - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Click "Select a project" â†’ "New Project"
   - Name it: "competitor-research-class"
   - Note your Project ID

3. **Authenticate locally**:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```
   - This will open a browser
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - Grant permissions

4. **Set your project**:
   ```bash
   gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   ```

---

## Step 5: Set Up Notion Integration

1. **Create Notion Account** (if you don't have one):
   - Go to https://notion.so and sign up

2. **Create Integration**:
   - Go to https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
   - Click "New integration"
   - Name: "Competitor Research Bot"
   - Type: "Internal"
   - Capabilities: Read, Update and Insert content; No user information.
   - In the Access tab, select your new page
   - Click "Submit"
   - **SAVE THE SECRET TOKEN** - you'll need it later

3. **Create Parent Page**:
   - In Notion, create a new page called "Competitor Analysis"
   - Share this page with your integration:
     - Click "Share" â†’ "Add people"
     - Search for your integration name
     - Give it "Full access"
   - **SAVE THE PAGE URL** - you'll need the ID from it

---

## Step 6: Clone the repo

1. **Open the IDE and its terminal** again 
2. (If not done) **Create a new folder for your code projects**: 
   ```bash
   mkdir Code
   ```
3. **Move into the new folder**:
   ```bash
   cd Code
   ```
4. Once in the new folder, **clone the repo**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elenamatay/compete-automate-notion.git
   ```
5. Open Project and open the new folder created inside the Code folder, called `compete-automation-notion`, which contains the repo. Since now, you'll be able to open and interact with the repo files shown in the left bar -your local version of it-.

---

## Step 7: Set Up Python Environment

1. **Navigate to your project folder**:
   - Open the terminal in your IDE
   - Check where you are currently:
     ```bash
     pwd  # Shows current directory
     ```
   - If you're not in the `compete-automate-notion` folder, navigate to it:
     ```bash
     cd Code/compete-automate-notion
     ```
   - Verify you're in the right place by listing the files:
     ```bash
     ls  # Should show files like compete.ipynb, requirements.txt, config.json
     ```

2. **Create virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv compete-automate-venv
   compete-automate-venv\Scripts\activate

   # macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv compete-automate-venv
   source compete-automate-venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Step 8: Configure Environment Files

1. **Create `.env` file**:
   - In your project root folder (`compete-automate-notion`), create a new file called `.env`
   - Copy the content from `env_template.txt` and paste it into your new `.env` file

2. **Edit `.env` file** with your information:
   ```
   NOTION_API_TOKEN=secret_YOUR_INTEGRATION_TOKEN_HERE
   NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_ID=YOUR_PAGE_ID_HERE
   NOTION_DATABASE_ID=  # Leave empty - will be created automatically
   ```

3. **Get your Notion Page ID**:
   - From your Notion page URL: `https://notion.so/Your-Page-NAME-HERE-abc123def456...`
   - The Page ID is the last 32 characters (after the last dash)
   - Example: if URL is `https://notion.so/My-Page-abc123def456789`, the ID is `abc123def456789`

4. **Edit `config.json`**:
   - Update company context for your use case
   - Modify competitor list in `competitors.csv`

---

## Step 9: Test Your Setup

1. **Activate your virtual environment** (if not already active):
   ```bash
   # Windows
   compete-automate-venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # macOS/Linux
   source compete-automate-venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Set up Google Cloud Application Default Credentials**:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```
   - This will open a browser window
   - **Important**: Sign in with the same Google account you used to create your Google Cloud project (the one with free credits)
   - If the browser opens with a different Google profile, copy the URL and paste it in an incognito window or the correct profile
   - Grant permissions when prompted
   - You may see a message about billing/quota project not being set

3. **Set your project for billing** (if prompted):
   ```bash
   gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   ```
   - Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual project ID
   - You can find your project ID in Google Cloud Console â†’ Project selector (top bar)
   - Continue until you see "Quota project is set to [your-project-id]"

4. **Open the notebook**: `compete.ipynb`

5. **Run the first cell** to test imports
