  "Relevance_To_NonTechnicalFounders": "High Relevance. With the launch of Rocket.new, DhiWise explicitly targets non-technical users, claiming 'no code required' for building applications using simple AI prompts. This directly aligns with Seido's mission to empower non-technical founders to build businesses without coding. [13]",
  "AI_As_Technical_Cofounder_Analogy": "Yes, DhiWise, particularly with its Rocket.new offering, positions itself as an 'AI software engineer' that assists users in building applications, including those without technical expertise. This aligns strongly with the 'AI as a technical cofounder' analogy, now extending beyond just enhancing developer productivity to enabling non-technical users. [13]",
  "Agent_Reusability_Platform_NetworkEffects": "DhiWise focuses on generating reusable code and components for application development. While Rocket.new introduces AI-powered prompt-based creation, there is no explicit mention of a platform for multi-agent systems or a marketplace for reusable AI agents, which remains a key differentiator for Seido. [13]",
  "EaseOfUse_For_SeidoPersonas": "Medium to High. While the core DhiWise platform is developer-centric, the new Rocket.new offering explicitly aims for ease of use for non-technical users by enabling app creation with 'simple prompts' and 'no code required'. The actual ease of use for complex business logic and AI integration for Seido's personas would need further evaluation, but the stated intent is a significant shift. [13]",
  "Seido_Differentiation_Points": "Seido differentiates itself by providing a comprehensive no-code platform for non-technical founders to build and scale AI-powered multi-agent systems, including an initial idea validation assessment and a marketplace for reusable AI agents. While DhiWise (via Rocket.new) is now moving into 'no code required' app building, its primary focus remains on generating traditional web/mobile application code. Seido's unique value lies in orchestrating and operationalizing *AI agent ecosystems* for business automation, a distinct offering from general app development. [13]",
  "Threat_Level_To_Seido": "Medium to High. Previously low, the threat level increases significantly with DhiWise's launch of Rocket.new, which explicitly targets non-technical users with 'no code required' app building via AI prompts. This directly overlaps with Seido's core value proposition of empowering non-technical founders to build without coding. However, Seido's specific focus on *multi-agent systems* and *AI-powered businesses* (beyond just general apps) still provides a differentiation. [13]",
  "Opportunity_For_Seido": "DhiWise's strategic shift with Rocket.new validates the growing market demand for AI-powered no-code solutions for non-technical users. Seido can capitalize on this by further emphasizing its specialized focus on enabling non-technical founders to build and scale *complex AI-powered multi-agent systems* and *entire AI-driven businesses*, which goes beyond standard web/mobile app generation. Seido's unique offering of an AI agent marketplace and comprehensive business automation capabilities remains a strong differentiator. [13]",
  "Notes_QualitativeInsights": "DhiWise has made a significant strategic pivot with the launch of Rocket.new, moving beyond its traditional developer-centric, pro-code focus to explicitly target non-technical users with 'no code required' AI-powered app building. This positions it as a more direct competitor to platforms like Seido that aim to empower non-technical founders. While DhiWise's strength remains in generating clean, production-ready code for standard web/mobile applications, Seido's differentiation lies in its focus on multi-agent systems and comprehensive AI-powered business automation.
